        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>(copied from <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/king-arthurs-classic-white-sandwich-bread-recipe">https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/king-arthurs-classic-white-sandwich-bread-recipe</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>This close-grained, nicely sliceable white sandwich loaf is the 
            perfect "go-to" bread for breakfast toast, brown-bag PB & Js, or a 
            grilled-cheese-and-soup supper. 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 &frac14; cups (284g) to 1 &frac12; cups (340g) lukewarm water*</li>
            <li>1 heaping tablespoon (32g) honey</li>
            <li>2 &frac14; teaspoons instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 &frac34; teaspoons (11g) salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (28g) butter, softened</li>
            <li>4 cups (480g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>&frac13; cup (37g) King Arthur Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a 
                cup, then sweeping off any excess. Mix all of the ingredients 
                in the order listed, and mix and knead &dash; by hand, or using a 
                stand mixer &dash; to make a smooth dough. It won't be particularly 
                soft nor stiff; it should be smooth and feel bouncy and elastic 
                under your hands.</li>            
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, or large (8-cup) 
                measuring cup. Cover it, and let it rise for 60 to 90 minutes, 
                till it's become quite puffy, though not necessarily doubled in 
                size.</li>
            <li>Gently deflate the dough, and shape it into a fat 9&quot; log. 
                Place it in a lightly greased 9&quot; x 5&quot; or 10&quot; x 
                5&quot; loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan, and let the dough rise for 60 to 90 minutes, 
                till it's crowned 1&quot; to 1 1/2&quot; over the rim of the 
                pan. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 
                350&#8457;.</li>
            <li>Bake the bread for 20 minutes. Tent it lightly with aluminum 
                foil, and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, till it's 
                golden brown. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the 
                center will read 195&#8457; to 200&#8457;.</li>
            <li>Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out onto a rack to 
                cool. When completely cool, wrap in plastic, and store at room 
                temperature.</li>
        </ol>
