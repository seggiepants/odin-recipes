        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>(copied from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19344/homemade-lasagna/">https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19344/homemade-lasagna/</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
            made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with 
            ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd 
            cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. 
            Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over 
                medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 
                to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh 
                parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat 
                to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly 
                salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling 
                water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the 
                bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 &#8457; 
                (190 &#8451;).</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 
                tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl 
                until combined.</li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the 
                bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place 
                two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 
                &frac12; of the cheese mixture, &frac12; of the remaining sauce, 
                and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more 
                using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and 
                mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the 
                foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before 
                cutting and serving.</li>
